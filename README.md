# PayPerDay

I created this project after I believed that I was being shorted on pay for my job. I wanted to create a project where I could add in what time I clocked in and out at and my current rate of pay to see how much I made that day to compare to what my job was paying me. After 8 hours of work, the wage amount automatically goes to 1.5x what it was currently set at.

the next version is to incorporate a week's work of in and out times
